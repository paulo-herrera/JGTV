      Process_Description: 
Each state for the lower 48 states was downloaded from http://tin.er.usgs.gov/geology/state/. 
A merge was performed then the merged file was re-projected to NAD83 Geographic, and imported into SDE. 
For specific Process Steps for each State, please see the metadata located at http://tin.er.usgs.gov/geology/state/
